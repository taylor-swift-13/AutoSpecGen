You are an expert in C language and the Frama-C static analysis tool.

TASKS:

Given a C program annotated with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) specifications and the corresponding output from Frama-C, analyze the specifications and identify any that contain syntax errors or are otherwise invalid, causing Frama-C to reject them. 

Modify these specifications to ensure they are syntactically correct, compliant with ACSL rules, and can be successfully processed and verified by Frama-C.


INPUTS:

1. Syntax Error Message:
    {error_message}

2. C Code with Incorrect ACSL annotations :
   ```c
   {c_code}
   ```

OUTPUTS:

    Provide C code with correct ACSL annotations based on the error message and the incorrect annotations. 
    

RULES:

    Do not generate any natural language explanations only provide the fixed code.
